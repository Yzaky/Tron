# Tron

Tron is a classic game inspired by the movie with the same name.

The principle is simple and can be seen as follows:

all players are in an arena enclosed by a white wall (which appears from above, like an empty square, the white outline on a black background, for example).

Each player has a color and a different starting position and appear initially as a colored dot in the arena ..

After starting, each player advances at high speed, and leaves behind a trace, a wall, color.

Players can change direction at right angles using the buttons: the only possible movement directions are North (top), South (down), East (right), west (left).

A player dies when he drives into a wall, the color of trace (the wall) left by another player, his own track or the white wall delimiting the arena.

In another variant, charge into the surrounding wall does not cause the death of the player, but the teleports to the other side (eg if it takes towards the west and meets the west wall, it reappears in the same height on the east side, still spinning at the same speed towards the west). We can implement the variant of our choice.

The winner of the game is the last to stay alive!
